# MCLBOT

This is a Discord bot I work on sporadically to learn both [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).

This project is a work in progress, actually I'm working more on the bot "framework" itself than writing / adding bot commands.

To invite this bot to your Discord server, [click this link.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=249732355030384641&scope=bot&permissions=8)
