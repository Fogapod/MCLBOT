# MCLBOT

This is a (still unfinished) Discord bot I work on sporadically to learn both [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).

This project is pretty much a work in progress, going to be a "proof of concept" how a good internal structure of a Discord bot could look like. If you have any suggestions please do not hesitate to contact me: `WRMSR#1550` on Discord (but please mention my bot, otherwise I won't accept you).

To invite this bot to your Discord server, [click this link.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=249732355030384641&scope=bot&permissions=8)

## Documentation

First off, you should be familiar with the [discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master).

To see how commands, events, tasks or types are structured, view the documentation in their respective folders:

- [commands](commands/README.md)
- [events](events/README.md)
- [tasks](tasks/README.md)
- [types](types/README.md)
- [middleware](middleware/README.md)

For the context object, see the [context documentation](context.md).
